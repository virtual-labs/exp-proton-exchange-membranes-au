### Learning Objectives

1.	To understand how the proton exchange membrane (PEM) helps in creating a proton gradient (H‚Å∫ ions) between the anode and cathode, thereby facilitating the flow of protons through the membrane.

2.	To learn how PEM acts as a barrier to separate the microbial activity at the anode from the cathode reactions and maintain redox balance microbial oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode.

3.	To identify high-quality PEM with good proton conductivity for higher power density production in MFCs.
